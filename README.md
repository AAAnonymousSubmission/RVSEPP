The repository contains code for CVPR 2023 submission paper titled "Selectively Hard Negative Mining for Alleviating Gradient Vanishing in Image-Text Matching".

The code is built on top of the [vse_infty](https://github.com/woodfrog/vse_infty). Except for the image encoder and loss function, other experimental settings are the same as [vse_infty](https://github.com/woodfrog/vse_infty).
